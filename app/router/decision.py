"""Inference-level decision — the heart of Obsidia Router.

Given the IR (structure), the gate verdict (frame) and the topic (semantics),
decide deterministically WHETHER a model is needed at all, and if so, which
level:

  Level 0  NO_MODEL   — status, HOLD, deny, clarification, commands-only
  Level 1  BRODY      — local proprietary LLM organ (stubbed in this cut)
  Level 2  MEMORY     — corpus lookup, no generation
  Level 3  FIREWORKS  — remote escalation, cheapest sufficient model

Classic agents route between models. Obsidia first decides if a model is
necessary.
